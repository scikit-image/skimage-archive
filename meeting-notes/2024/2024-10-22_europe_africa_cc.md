## Agenda

- [NumFOCUS board election](https://github.com/numfocus/elections)
  - How do we allocate our 3 votes as a member project
    - Something like [Instant-runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) might be a good fit if we can implement it
  - Action: Schedule short team meeting to achieve consensus on vote 

- Release 0.25.0
  - Status?
  - Pyodide wheels: ping [Agriya Khetarpal](https://github.com/agriyakhetarpal)

- EOSS5 no-cost extension
  - > approved internally and [...] the funder, SVCF [...] should be in touch with the amendment within the coming weeks. 
  - new grant end date: January 31, 2026
    - At current burn rate, will spend funds by ~October/November 2025
  - interim report due: 1/1/2025
  - final report due: 4/1/2026

- Move gallery testing into its own shorter running workflow without running the test suite?
  - Do only a single gallery run, in parallel; disable for other docs builds
    - Should not need to build docs on >1 platform
  - Can also reduce coverage; not needed on multiple platforms
  - Mark certain tests as slow, and only run them on a single target (e.g., rolling ball)
  - Ensure we have caching on repeated PRs

- **Review coordination & triage**
  - [Feature/enhance plot matched features #7541](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/7541), waiting for 2nd approval
    - [x] Added cycle example to docstring -> [name=Lars] to rephrase
  - Anything else...?
