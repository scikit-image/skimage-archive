## Agenda

- [HackMD doc by Scientific Python](https://hackmd.io/@scientific-python/HJWUBDVNi) is read-only?
  - Message "Sorry, this team is disabled. You can't edit this note."
  - HackMD agreed to upgrade our account again; Stéfan emailed them to find out when this will happen
- Respond to [New (experimental) type stubs for skimage](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/621)
  - One of the goals of the CZI5 grant is to add type annotations to scikit-image
  - might be a useful starting point / reference to keep in mind
- Release 0.20
  - Blocked by [Build wheels for arm64 on macos
#6667](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/6667) -> [seems to work now!](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/6667#issuecomment-1385737507)
  - [0.20 milestone](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/milestone/22), ~16 open items
- Talked about some growing pains with meson-python, e.g. [meson python editable install issues](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/issues/47#issuecomment-1377181559)
- Documentation on setting up a dev environment is broken / inconsistent
  - pip & conda use different version specification syntaxes
  - packages may be named differently on PyPI and conda-forge
  - See https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/6494#issuecomment-1385695486
  - CI should test dev environment setup
- Revise our HTML documentation
  - Use pydata-sphinx-theme, e.g. [networkx also uses a gallery](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/auto_examples/index.html)
  - Lars intends to prepare a draft PR
- Logo redesign, see https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/536
- Lars and Marianne are waiting for their contracts to start using the funds from the CZI5 grant.
  - [x] Lars will poke NumFOCUS about this on Slack.
- Marianne asked about announcing our two paid internships: now would be a good time to start advertising for them, since students are typically starting to look for summer internships.
  - Stéfan said that Juan should be back in Australia, and we may want to meet online with him about this.
  - We can use https://jobs.numfocus.org/ to publish the two offers.
  - We can also use https://blog.scientific-python.org/ to spread the word.
