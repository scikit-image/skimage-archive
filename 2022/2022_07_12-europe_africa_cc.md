## Topics

### SciPy '22 sprint

* July 16–17, 2022
* Alex thinks it should be virtual, on [Discord: Mentored Sprints](https://discord.gg/EvmCVQ3xTU)
    * Marianne is +1
    * Sat/Sun asynchronously; you're there, you're there. No pressure!
    * Structure is already there:

    * A bunch of us are there, too (Greg, Marianne, Juan at least)
    * If sprints can't be virtual, they can be... coincidental (rogue :wink:)
* Is the sprint already submitted on [scipy2022/sprints](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/sprints)?
    * A: need to check with Greg if he will be available on-site; AFAIK, only Greg is attending. Not sure about their aptitude with virtual sprints

* New CZI application

### Roadmap update

Marianne was away for three months, so she asked for some update on the project
(1.0 release, skimage2, grant applications, ...).

* Lars summed up the content of the CZI EOSSS cycle-5 application.
* We discussed career paths (working in open-source, leaving academia, etc.).
* Alex highlighted more distinct issue and pull request labels on GitHub (icons may help with recognition)
* Alex and Lars confirmed that non-breaking API changes can go into 1.0., e.g. [PR 6425](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/6425)
* Also after 1.0, modernize the HTML documentation maybe using the theme from NumPy or SciPy
