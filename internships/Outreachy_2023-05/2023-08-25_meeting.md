## Agenda

### Internship wrap-up

The theme for this week (final week, week 13) is "Internship wrap-up."

Ananya and Biola told us that they discovered and appreciated the *scientific* component of their Python programming internships. This will leave its mark on their respective career and community building endeavours.

### Feedback for Ananya

Marianne thinks that Ananya has acquired or improved the following skills during the internship.

* Programming
    * Creating [subplots](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html) in Matplotlib.
    * Writing convenience functions.
    * Using intensity [histograms](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.exposure.html#skimage.exposure.histogram) for exploring/analyzing images.
    * Using [thresholding](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_thresholding.html).
    * Applying [morphological operations](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_morphology.html).
    * Trying various strategies for [segmenting](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.segmentation.html) images.

* Methodology
    * Documenting every non-trivial technical step (e.g., in a wiki), including negative results.
    * Practising industry-standard [collaborative workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
    * Practising collaborative [workflows with single remote](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/334488/code-review-workflow-where-pull-request-author-must-merge).
    * Using [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for collaborating on notebooks.
    * Reporting bugs.

* Communication
    * Creating educational materials (standalone tutorials) with text, code, and visualizations.
    * Emailing authors of software packages if documentation is lacking.

### Covered during Adeyemi's internship

- Communication
    - Industry-standard GitHub-based [collaborative workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) and [workflows with single remote](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/334488/code-review-workflow-where-pull-request-author-must-merge).
    - Discussing complex algorithms and implementations such as thin-plate warping in English, both in writing and verbally
    - Writing and reviewing technical documentation for an image processing pipeline
- Programming & practices & technologies
    - Understanding and modifying a thin-plate warping implementation involving complexer linear algebra, interpolation and vectorization
    - Translating between a scientific paper and an implementation (and vice versa)
    - Documenting code in the NumPy Docstring standard
    - Creating unit tests with PyTest for scientific algorithms
    - API design and patterns in the scientific Python ecosystem
- Image processing concepts
    - Morphological operations, filtering, inpainting, interpolation, warping & geometric transformations, thresholding

### Future internships?

Funding for future internships might be available through:

* [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/)
* and/or the [PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/).

### Expectations and hopes going forward?

- Future contributions?
  * Education: https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/
- Attending? Speaking? Teaching? at conferences:
  * SciPy / EuroSciPy
  * PyData (cf. https://www.eventyco.com/events/conferences/tech~python~pydata)
  * Meetups
- Becoming a scikit-image core dev?
- Following what's happening in the Scientific Python Ecosystem at your desired level of detail (cf. https://scientific-python.org/summits/developer/2023/#meeting-notes).
