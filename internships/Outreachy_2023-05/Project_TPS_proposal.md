### Project Description

**Title:** Enhance image warping in scikit-image with thin-plate splines

scikit-image is a Python library for image processing with scientific focus. Its transform module provides a set of algorithms to warp and transform images or volumetric data. These are used in feature detection, image alignment, data compression, modelling, or to correct distortions in fields such as medical imaging, geology, and machine learning.

The focus of the internship is to add a new image warping function using thin-plate splines (TPS) to scikit-image. TPS can be imagined as if bending a thin plate smoothly between two sets of points. This deformation can be interpreted as a warped image when viewed from a 2-dimensional perspective. The method is flexible, reliable, and produces a smooth, continuous transformation that preserves the local shape of the image. These properties are useful in many applications and would be a great addition to the toolkit of scikit-image's users.

Candidates may be self-taught, hold or be completing a BSc in Computer Science, Applied Math, or another computational discipline (or equivalent). Experience and/or interest in open-source software, scientific data analysis, image processing, and/or technical writing are very welcome.

### Internship Tasks
Foremost, the internship is meant as a learning experience for the intern, and mentors will try to adjust tasks to the strengths and skill level of the intern.

In the beginning, the mentor (and co-mentor) will provide the intern with several resources, starting points and smaller tasks. These might involve related issues in scikit-image‚Äôs transform module, or tasks to get familiar with the project‚Äôs infrastructure and important concepts. Self-initiative and new ideas by the intern are of course very welcome.

Once accustomed, a new warping function based on thin-plate spines could be implemented and added to scikit-image. A [prototype implementation of the algorithm already exists in Python](https://github.com/zpincus/celltool/blob/8d7a2b778cd45cf91588451f7f3c4784b049a82c/celltool/numerics/image_warp.py) and may be taken as a starting point. Together with mentors and the community, the intern will design an API for the implementation that is consistent with the transform module and create tests ensuring its correctness.

Depending on the progress during the internship, the intern may also optimize the performance of the algorithm and create a new tutorial or gallery example for the new function.

### Intern Benefits
The intern will experience the end-to-end process from conception of a new idea to its integration into an existing API. With the help of mentors and the community, the intern may expand their skill set in a wide range of concepts and technologies. This will involve API design, code maintainability, performence optimization, and effective collaboration on these things. 

Apart from personal improvement, the intern will also engage with and become part of a welcoming, skilled, international and science focused community that values openness, collaboration and diversity. The mentors and the scikit-image team would be very happy to see new opportunities develop following the internship.

### Community Benefits
This project will add a robust, flexible and requested warping algorithm to the scikit-image and in extension make it available to a wide community of scientists and Python users. This, and smaller tasks that are part of the internship, will also benefit the codebase and scikit-image and in general. It is the hope of the scikit-image team, that this internship will be an entry point for a new member of the open source community.

### Project Contribution Information
As part of the application process, all applicants must make at least one contribution to be accepted as an intern for this project. Only applicants who make a contribution will be eligible to be accepted as interns. This community requires applicants to complete a tutorial before they can make their contributions.

Please build your development environment by following these instructions: https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/contribute.html

Applicants can contribute to this project through [the project repository or contribution page](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image). The project uses an [issue tracker](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues) to keep information about bugs to fix, project features to implement, documentation to write, and more. Applicants can look for newcomer-friendly issues to use for their first contributions by looking for the following issue tags in the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues): üî∞ Good first issue

During the application period, candidates should start by reading the [Contribution guide](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/contribute.html), followed by setting up a local development environment. Following that, several smaller contribution tasks can be chosen to work on:

- Extend incomplete or very terse docstrings. This could include adding or extending the examples section of functions, or more detailed parameter descriptions. Candidates may look for terse docstrings themselves or choose from these lists (please pick only one item of each issue):
  - [Add docstrings to every submodule in skimage #6761](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/6761)
  - More advanced: [Add short examples to transform classes #6808](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/6808)
- Choose an [issue tagged as ‚ÄúGood first issue‚Äù](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%3Abeginner%3A+Good+first+issue%22) to work on.
- Participate in issues and pull requests that have been recently active, especially those of other Outreachy applicants. The goal here is just to get familiar with the interface, the development and review process. Constructively asking for clarification if a description, implementation or documentation is hard to follow can be a very valuable contribution!

Candiades are welcome to introduce themselves in scikit-image's [Outreachy topic on Zulip](https://skimage.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/176555-sprint/topic/Outreachy). Mentors and other library maintainers will monitor this chat room and are happy to help with any questions that may arise.

### Mentor experience (@lagru)

> 1. *Has the mentor participated in Outreachy before?*

No, I have never mentored before

> 2. *What is the contributor's mentorship style (how do they expect to interact with accepted interns)?*

An asynchronous and open communication style via scikit-image's established channels (GitHub, developer forum, emailing, messaging) is preferred. A weekly, structured meeting (video-conferencing) should be part of the regular mentor-intern communication. The mentor is willing to pair program with the intern and happy to work together on a specific issue. Asking for help and sharing thought processes and problems is very much encouraged.
    
> 3. *How long has the mentor been a contributor to the team that the intern will be working with (e.g. the team of contributors for a particular subsystem, application, module, documentation team, user experince team, graphical design team, etc)?*

The mentor has contributed to this team for more than 2 years

> 4. *What contributions has this mentor made to the team or other FOSS communities?*

The mentor has been a core-developer for scikit-image for more than 2 years and contributed reviews, bug fixes, new features, general maintenance, helped with community management, funding proposals and participated in discussions. He also contributed to other packages in the scientific Python ecosystem, e.g. NumPy and SciPy among them. During that time his emphasis has been on peak finding, API design, optimization and maintenance.
