## Agenda

### Review of the week

- How did it go wrt Week 2 from [Timeline](https://hackmd.io/@mkcor/outreachy-roadmap)?
    - Interns didn't even have to be 'productive' yet!
    - Read to learn *and* code to practise.
    - It's motivating to have a specific goal (see next item).
- Finish inpainting example [#6853](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/6853)?
    - pressure vs. drive
    - [x] Marianne adds last visualization and credits Biola.
- async communication: OK
- office hour on Wednesday at 13:00 UTC: OK

### Embryonic development project

- Read dataset
- Select one frame
    - Ananya used scipy and pandas so far.
    - But how do you make sense of it?
        - high level: read supplementary material
        - low level: inspect the array (dim? shape?) and *visualize* it
            - Use napari?
- What are we seeing? Is spacing regular in all 3 spatial dimensions? Is the 3D image grayscale or multichannel?
- First, focus on the 3D segmentation (one frame).
- The big picture is about measuring growth velocity(ies).

### Collaboration process

- Marianne would like to `spin jupyter-lab`...
    - Lars explained why you need to `spin` to set the `PYTHONPATH`; recommends current workaround:
    ```bash
    $ spin shell
    $ jupyter-lab
    ```
    in a virtualenv where you have jupyter-lab installed and scikit-image in development. 
- How can we best share notebooks?
  - Share notebooks via a Git repository.
      - [ ] Marianne creates a dedicated repo.
  - Lars: Use format https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

### Roadmap

 - Interns would like to have a timeline for the TPS project as well.
 - Week of July 9th, 2023 will be off for scikit-image projects.
     - [x] Marianne emails the Outreachy organizers to let them know.
