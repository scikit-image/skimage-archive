## Agenda

### Review of the week

- Announcement: one intern per project from now on.
    - [ ] Marianne: email Outreachy to update person/project info.
- Week 4: [Timeline](https://hackmd.io/@mkcor/outreachy-roadmap)

### Movie 7 (animal hemisphere microscopy)

- Viewer (napari)
    - Share screen.
    - Use ImageIO's V3 API.
    - Use [wiki](https://github.com/mkcor/draft-notebooks/wiki) to document small experiments.
- Compare with movie 10?
- Movies are actually not *data*.
- Data are in the MAT-files.

### Data set 2 (zebrafish animal hemisphere)

- EDA (exploratory data analysis):
    - Biola's [notebook](https://github.com/mkcor/draft-notebooks/blob/main/embryo/biola_embryonic.ipynb).
- Nuclei are already segmented!
- Each time point is a table where each row is a nucleus and columns are its X, Y, Z coords, fluorescence, etc.
    - Is this dataset the output from the MATLAB segmentation pipeline described in the supplementary material?
    - How can we make use of the variables stored for each nucleus?
    - Turn this triplet representation into a SciPy sparse matrix?
    - 

### Next steps

- Visualize one time point (frame) or a slice thereof (along Z axis)?
- Write a (naive) function for tracking nuclei from one frame to the next?
- Reshape the dataset to feed it (beginning with two frames) to a 3D cell tracking program?

### Miscellaneous

- Re-schedule Europe/Africa Community Call?
- [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) is an alternative to Conda.
