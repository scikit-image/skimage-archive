## Agenda

### Review of the week

- Week 5: [Timeline](https://hackmd.io/@mkcor/outreachy-roadmap)
- Getting close to finishing PR for inpainting example!
- Emailed authors (Prof. Keller and Prof. Wittbrodt)

### Digital embryo datasets

- 2008 paper: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1162493
- Older technology: DSLM (Digital Scanned Laser Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy)
- Zebrafish
- Segmentation result in MAT-files:
    - Ananya visualized coordinates, drawing inspiration from https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.12-three-dimensional-plotting.html#Three-dimensional-Points-and-Lines

### Newer datasets (2012-2020)

- Zebrafish, Mouse, Drosophila
- SiMView and SiMView-AutoPilot imaging technology
- Video abstract (mouse): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418312431
- IDR repository: https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-502

### TPS project

- Biola shared project updates.
- Biola has to set up a dev env once again from scratch and is facing issues (upon running tests and importing the library) whereas build doesn't complain.
- Ananya shared her experience setting up a dev env on OS X as well (Apple Silicon vs Intel processors).

### Next steps

- Are we still interested in the 2008 zebrafish data?
- Use a dataset from http://celltrackingchallenge.net/3d-datasets/ (as in https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/tracking/cell_tracking.html?)
- For one frame, compare result from 'native' 3D segmentation with 'Z-stacked' 2D segmentation.
