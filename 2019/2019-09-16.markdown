## Items from the previous meeting

## Agenda

Search for `TODO` to find action items.

- blocking issues for 0.16
    - full list of issues from milestone is here: https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/milestone/12
        - I don't think we will get through more than a small fraction of these. I will prioritise bugs here.
        - PRs discussed:
            - [3125](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3125) : TODO N-d rotation matrices; Josh W will take a look
            - [3173](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3173) : TODO Stéfan will take a look, apparently he is blocking that one
            - [3928](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3928) : needs a more descriptive docstring for the `load_pattern` argument; TODO Alex will do
        - Issues discussed:
            - 3980: TODO need to fix discrepancy between Otsu/Multi-Otsu — Alex will take a quick look
            - 3785: TODO should be a quick fix, Juan will take a look
    
- Reviews are needed for:
    - [fix anisotropic blob finding](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4162) (Juan)
    - [add drawline nd](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/2043) (Juan)

- suggestion: lower deprecation length from two to one cycle - at least for changes where we can detect the old/now incorrect behavior
    - TODO propose to mailing list: Josh Warner will do

- governance
    - Requesting another round of review on [PR 3585](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3585) (SKIPs, vision/values, and governance) (Stéfan)

- API overrides
    - [NEP 18](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html)
    - [__array__ function in dask](https://blog.dask.org/2019/03/18/dask-nep18)
    - [uarray](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/uarray)

- benchmarking
    - Should we *require* benchmarks?
    - Do we want benchmarks which may take higher time to run (larger images, etc.)
    - Conclusion: add benchmark for performance regressions, or places that we care about specifically
    - Josh: Perhaps we could consider a set of benchmarks on 12 MPxl (lower bound) images in ASV, covering typical use of a majority of at least core/highly used functions?
